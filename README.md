# Testing scenarios for Azure Container Apps scale options

Testing CPU load with Azure Container Apps scale options involves simulating varying levels of CPU usage to evaluate how
containerized applications respond to scaling triggers. Azure Container Apps supports automatic scaling based on CPU
thresholds, allowing developers to test how quickly and efficiently instances scale out or in under load. This helps
validate performance, cost-efficiency, and resilience of the application in real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with permissions to create and manage Azure Container Apps.
- Azure CLI installed and configured.
- A containerized application that can simulate CPU load (e.g., a simple web server or a custom application).
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and container orchestration.
- Azure Container Apps environment set up.
- A monitoring tool (like Azure Monitor) to track CPU usage and scaling events.
- Dotnet 9.0 SDK installed.

## Steps to Test CPU Load with Azure Container Apps Scale Options

1. **Set Up Azure Container Apps Environment**:
   - Create a resource group in Azure.
   - Set up an Azure Container Apps environment.
   - Deploy your containerized application to the Azure Container Apps environment.
   - Configure the application to expose metrics for CPU usage.
   - Ensure that the application can handle load generation (e.g., through an endpoint that simulates CPU load).
   - Configure scaling rules based on CPU usage (e.g., scale out when CPU usage exceeds 70% and scale in when it drops below 30%).
   - Set minimum and maximum instance counts for scaling.
   - Ensure that the application is accessible for load testing.
   - Set up logging and monitoring to track CPU usage and scaling events.
   - Test the application to ensure it is functioning correctly before applying load.
   - Document the initial configuration and scaling rules for reference.
   - Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to modify scaling settings in the Azure Container Apps environment.
   - Verify that the Azure Container Apps environment is properly configured to handle scaling events.
   - Ensure that the application is stateless or can handle state appropriately during scaling events.
   - Set up alerts in Azure Monitor to notify you of scaling events and CPU usage thresholds.
   - Review Azure Container Apps pricing to understand the cost implications of scaling.
   - Ensure that you have a rollback plan in case the scaling tests impact application availability.
   - Familiarize yourself with Azure Container Apps documentation for any specific configurations or limitations.

2. **Simulate CPU Load**:
    - Use a load testing tool (e.g., Apache JMeter, Locust, or a custom script) to generate CPU load on the application.
    - Gradually increase the load to observe how the application scales.
    - Monitor CPU usage and scaling events in real-time using Azure Monitor or other monitoring tools.
    - Record the time taken for scaling events to occur after reaching CPU thresholds.
    - Ensure that the load testing tool is configured to simulate realistic traffic patterns.
    - Use a variety of load patterns (e.g., steady load, spike load, gradual)
